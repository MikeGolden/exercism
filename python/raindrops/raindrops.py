def convert(number):
    """
    Convert a number into a string containing raindrop sounds corresponding to its factors.

    The function takes an integer 'number' and applies the following rules:
    - If 'number' has 3 as a factor, 'Pling' is added to the result.
    - If 'number' has 5 as a factor, 'Plang' is added to the result.
    - If 'number' has 7 as a factor, 'Plong' is added to the result.
    - If 'number' does not have 3, 5, or 7 as factors, the result is the digits of the number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to be converted.

    Returns:
        str: A string containing raindrop sounds or the digits of the input number.
