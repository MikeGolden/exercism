def find_fewest_coins(coins, target):
    """
    Find the fewest number of coins needed to reach a target value using the given coin denominations.

    Args:
        coins (list of int): A list of coin denominations available for making change.
        target (int): The target value to reach using the coins.

    Returns:
        list of int: A sorted list of coin denominations that make up the fewest coins to reach the target.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the target value is negative or cannot be reached with the given coins.

    The function uses dynamic programming to determine the optimal combination of coins that
    minimizes the total number of coins needed to reach the target value. It returns the list
    of coin denominations in ascending order.

    If it's not possible to reach the target value using the given coins, a ValueError is raised.
