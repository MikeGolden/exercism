def proverb(*lst, qualifier):
    """
    Generate a proverbial saying based on a list of items and an optional qualifier.

    This function generates a proverbial saying based on a list of items, where each item
    represents a cause of the next item's loss, and an optional `qualifier` can be included
    to modify the first item in the list.

    Args:
        *lst: A variable number of items (strings) representing causes of loss.
        qualifier (str, optional): An optional qualifier to modify the first item.

    Returns:
        list: A list of strings forming the proverbial saying.

    Example:
        >>> proverb("nail", "shoe", "horse", "rider", "message", "battle", "kingdom")
        [
            "For want of a nail the shoe was lost.",
            "For want of a shoe the horse was lost.",
            "For want of a horse the rider was lost.",
            "For want of a rider the message was lost.",
            "For want of a message the battle was lost.",
            "For want of a battle the kingdom was lost."
        ]
